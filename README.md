# Dumpling

Dumpling is a light-weight, minimal research paper manager from the terminal. With the CLI tool, basic information on research papers 
can be created, that can subsequently be explored by the TUI. Inside the TUI a minimal amount of essential actions can be performed. 

By default, the application assumes papers are stored in `$HOME/.paper/`. The paper files created by the CLI tool are stored in the 
`$HOME/.cache/dumpling` directory.

## Installation

For easy installation, a `Makefile` is provided. It is assumed that `GNU Make` and `Rust` are installed on you system. To build the application run:
```
$ make
```
To move the resulting compiled application to the /usr/bin/ directory so it can be accessed globally in you system run:
```
$ make install
```
Lastly, to clean files from the compilation process:
```
$ make clean
```

## Usage 

Dumpling provides a single CLI tool called `dumpling`. The following 
arguments can be attached to it:

| Short form | Long form | Argument | Action |
|------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| -t | --title | "\[TITLE\]" | Set title of paper |
| -y | --year | INT | Set year of publication |
| / | --desc | "\[DESCRIPTION\]" | Short description of the papers contents |
| -b | --bibtex | '''\[BIB\]''' | Bibtex formatted reference for the paper |
| / | --doc | "\[DOCNAME\]" | Name of the PDF document, the directory is set in the configuration file and should not be provided |
| / | --filter-tag | "\[TAG\]" |Show only papers with certain tag. NOTE: this has not been implemented yet.|
| -a | --author | "\[AUTHOR\]" | Add author for the paper, this option can be used multiple times. |
| / | --tag | "\[TAG\]" | Add tag to paper, this option can be used multiple times. |
| -o | --open | No argument | Open the TUI. |
| / | --list-tags | No argument | List all the tags used. NOTE: this has not been implemented yet. |

Note: If you run `dumpling` without any arguments, a default paper 
information entry will be generated. We suggest not using it until we fix 
this behaviour.

Note: The `--filter-tag` and `--list-tag` options have not yet been implemented.

## Configuration

The user can create their own configuration for certain elements of the program with a configuration file. When starting the program, it will search 
for the presence of `$HOME/.config/dumpling/dumpling.toml`, in case that file is not found, default settings will be used. The configuration `toml` 
file consists of three section
