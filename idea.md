Project for managing papers, i.e. a short description what it is about, the authors, the year it was published, file path to the `pdf` file on the 
system, bib citation for the paper etc. 

In the .cache/dumpling/ directory we store the configuration files for each paper that has been entered, and we could suggest making a $HOME/.paper 
directory to store the pdf files.
